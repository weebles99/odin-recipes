    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Before You Start: Gather all the ingredients. For the steamed rice, please note that 1½ cups (300 g, 2 rice cooker cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice yield 4⅓ cups (660 g) of cooked rice, enough for 2 donburi servings</li>
        <li>Cut 2 leaves iceberg lettuce into julienne strips and 2 green onions/scallions into thin rounds.</li>
        <li>Slice 2 cloves garlic and grate 1 knob ginger.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the seasonings ingredients: the grated ginger, 2 Tbsp sake, 2 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned), 3 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp sugar, and ½ tsp toasted sesame oil. Whisk it all together.</li>
        <li>Pound 2 boneless pork loin chops (½-inch thick) to tenderize and make an equal thickness.</li>
        <li>Season the pork with ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Dust the pork with 1 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch and remove the excess starch.</li>
        <li>In a nonstick frying pan, heat 1 Tbsp neutral oil on medium heat. While the oil is still cold, add the garlic slices and coat with the oil. Add the meat and cook until the bottom side is nicely browned.</li>
        <li>Flip it over, reduce the heat to medium low, and add the seasonings mixture. Cook, covered, for 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and spoon some sauce over the pork a few times. Add the chopped green onions and remove the pan from the heat.</li>
        <li>Take out the meat and slice it into a few pieces. Serve 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice in a individual donburi bowls, and place the shredded lettuce on top.</li>
        <li>Place the teriyaki pork on top of the lettuce. Pour the pan sauce on top and garnish with 2 cherry tomatoes on the side.</li>
