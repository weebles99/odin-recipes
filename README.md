# odin-recipes
this is a recipe list project for educational purposes in my goal to learn to code.
I will be demonstrating html, command line use, and git usage while creating this project.
this is only the starting point and I intend to proceed with The Odin Project until I hit a roadblock and get stuck. then I will break through that roadblock instead of giving up.
